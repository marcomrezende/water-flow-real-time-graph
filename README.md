# water-flow-real-time-graph
Scientific Initiation Project centered on the empirical evaluation of separation efficiency solid-liquid water from the Rio Negro using a 3D printed hydrocyclone integrated into a system with flow sensor of an Arduino for water instant connection of water through a real-time graph made using Visual Code Studio, Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS and ExpressJS.
